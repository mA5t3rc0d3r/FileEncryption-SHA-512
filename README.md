# FileEncryption-SHA-512
File Encryption With SHA-512 Encryption
In this Project , I managed to build an encryption software for any type of file.
The Project consists of ue of SHA-512 Algorithm which is used for Hashing the Passkey,
and Encrypting the File Details.



#About SHA-512 (Secure Hash Algorithm)

SHA-512 is an hashing algorithm used widely to hash data like(credentials , password)
It belongs to the SHA family.The SHA-512 belongs to the SHA-2 family which appeared
into the world in the early-2000's. The designing credit for SHA-512 goes to the 
National Security Agency(NSA).
SHA-512 is identical in structure to SHA-256,

1. The message is broken into 1024-bit chunks,
2. The initial hash values and round constants are extended to 64 bits,
3. There are 80 rounds instead of 64,
4. The message schedule array w has 80 64-bit words instead of 64 32-bit words,
5. To extend the message schedule array w, the loop is from 16 to 79 instead of from 16 to 63,
6. The round constants are based on the first 80 primes 2..409,
7. The word size used for calculations is 64 bits long,
8. The appended length of the message (before pre-processing), in bits, is a 128-bit big-endian integer, and
9. The shift and rotate amounts used are different.


#Use Of The Software

For Encrypting the Files Run The FileEncryption.jar.
Working Of the Software is Quiet Easy and i hope all will understand it....



Coding Is Fun.......

Happy Coding!!!
